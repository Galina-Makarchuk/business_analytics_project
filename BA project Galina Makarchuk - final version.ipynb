    "\n",
    "* Sources 9 and 10 are the lowest in terms of spending: 2% of the marketing budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the beginning, the marketing costs were low, then they started raising from September, and from January there is a gradual decrease in the spendings.\n",

    "* The highest spendings on marketing were from October until December, while the lowest – in August.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In August all marketing sources got the least budget.\n",

    "* The marketing costs correlate strongly with the number of visitors per month during the whole period.\n",

    "* __The lack of correlation between marketing costs and revenue from November__ could occur due to:\n",
    "    * market saturation: in a saturated market, increased marketing spend might not lead to significant revenue growth, as potential customers have limited choices\n",
    "    * decreasing returns: after a certain point, additional marketing spend may bring lower returns, meaning that further investment doesn’t significantly boost revenue\n",

    "* LTV\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conversion__ shows when customers start paying, how long it takes from the first visit to the purchase. \\\n",
    "On average, a website visitor makes a purchase on the same day. \\\n",
    "75% of visitors are converted into buyers within 2 days. \\\n",
    "This can be due to the fact that people use the service with a purpose to either look up an event or to buy a ticket for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conversions rate__ reflects the number of visitors that made a purchase. \\\n",
    "It’s a key indicator of marketing effectiveness and helps determine which marketing channel is most effective. \\\n",
    "Overall, 16% of users are converted into buyers. \\\n",
    "At first glance, it takes marketing channels 3 and 4 the longest to convert customers. \\\n",
    "But further exploration of the data shows that the total convertion time strongly correlates with the number of ads per channel. \\\n",
    "Ad source 9 requires the longest time to convert customers into buyers, and has the lowest conversion rate. \\\n",
    "While sources 1 and 10 take the least time to convert visitors into buyers, and have the highest conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Number of orders__ helps understand if purchasing behavior changes over time depending on a cohort. \\\n",
    "A customer makes on average 1 order in his 0th lifetime, and after that the number of orders drops significantly for each cohort for all subsequent months. \\\n",
    "This can be because customers use the service just to buy a ticket for a particular event and do not spend money on the service further on. \\\n",
    "June cohort has the highest number of orders during all lifetimes. \\\n",
    "Cumulatively, all summer months, September and November cohorts make 1.5-2 orders per user by the end of their lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Average check__ shows the typical amount spent per transaction and can inform pricing and upselling strategies. \\\n",
    "The average purchase size per customer and overall is 2.5 usd. \\\n",
    "There is no seasonal effect on the average check per month, despite the lower number of visitors during autumn-winter month. \\\n",
    "The possible reason for it, is that loyal customers steadily pay each month and thus compensate for the lower user engagement during spring-summer months. \\\n",
    "Overall, customers start spending more money over time. \\\n",
    "September and December cohorts have high average check during all their lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Comparing the number of orders with the average check__, these trends in the customer behavior can be seen:\n",
    "* June cohort makes lots of transactions, but the purchase size per order is small\n",
    "* September and December cohorts make less orders, but pay more for each order\n",

    "Sources 9 and 10 are the cheapest: 2% of the marketing budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing costs follow a curve: low in the beginning, raising from September, decreasing from January.\\\n",
    "From October until December marketing costs are the highest, in August all sources got the least budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing costs correlate strongly with MAU during the whole period, and with the revenue until October.\\\n",
    "This can be explained by:\n",
    "* increased product awareness and an enhanced engagement with it, leading to higher customer trust and willingness to purchase\n",
    "* targeted campaigns that help attract new customers, which directly contributes to increased sales and revenue\n",
    "* promotions or loyalty programs and personalized communication, which help maintain or increase MAU and enhance retention encouraging repeat purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "From November the revenue is not correlated with the marketing costs and MAU.\n",
    "This could occur due to:\n",
    "* market saturation: in a saturated market, increased marketing spend might not lead to significant revenue growth, as potential customers have limited choices\n",
    "* decreasing returns: after a certain point, additional marketing spend may bring lower returns, meaning that further investment doesn’t significantly boost revenue\n",
    "* external factors: lack of events, or changes in consumer behavior can impact revenue independently of marketing spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Customer acquisition cost (CAC)__ reflects the money a new customer costs a company. \\\n",
    "Attracting customers via the ad sources 2 and 3 is the most expensive (12.2 and 13.5 usd per user) and stays high during the whole year.\\\n",
    "But their conversion rate is close to that of the channels 1, 4 and 5, while CAC for these channels is almost twice less.\\\n",
    "Customer acquisition from the sources 9 and 10 costs the least amount of money (4.4 and 5.1 usd per user).\\\n",
    "At the same time, the conversion rate is high for these ad channels, which makes them worth expanding.\\\n",
    "CAC of the other ad sources stays between 3 and 10 usd during the whole year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum CAC is in May (7.4 usd).\\\n",
    "The highest CAC is in August (10.8 usd).\\\n",
    "CAC does not vary a lot per month. It stays around the average value during the whole period, except for May.\\\n",
    "At the same time, marketing costs have strong variation during the whole period.\\\n",
    "It means that high marketing costs do bring lots of new buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Comparing the customer acquisition cost with the average check per month__ shows that CAC is higher than the average purchase size throughout all months. \\\n",
    "It can mean:\n",
    "* high marketing costs to acquire customers, but customers aren’t spending much on their purchases.\n",
    "* unbalanced promotional strategies when customers buy at lower price through promotions. This drops the average purchase size, making CAC high.\n",
    "* low LTV when customers don’t tend to return or make repeat purchases, making the initial acquisition cost lower than their spendings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also notable that peak CAC values correspond to low purchase sizes, and vice versa. \\\n",
    "This can be explained by the time shift between marketing and purchase: people start buying only a month later after a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Return on investment (ROI)__ \\\n",
    "ROI is below 0 for all months for all cohorts, except for June and September cohorts.\\\n",
    "Only 2 cohorts have paid off: the September cohort - by the 3rd month, the June cohort - by the 6th month.\\\n",
    "The LTV for these 2 cohorts also stands out – they are the highest among all cohorts, while the CAC values are very similar to other cohorts.\\\n",
    "This is a healthy per-customer economics, where LTV is greater than CAC, and ROI is above 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The January cohort has the lowest ROI initially, and by the 4th lifetime month as well. This can be due to high CAC and low LTV values for this cohort.\\\n",
    "The August cohort has the highest CAC, but its ROI is below 0.\\\n",
    "At the same time CAC for September is lower, but ROI is the highest.\\\n",
    "It can mean that customers acquired in August started actively making purchases only in September.\\\n",
    "In general, the cohorts behave differently in terms of ROI, despite almost the same costs spent on them. It means that ROI is mostly influenced by LTV and not CAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)__ \\\n",
    "Only ad sources 1, 2, 5 and 9 have paid off.\\\n",
    "Source 1 has the highest ROMI. Marketing spendings on it paid off on 149%. This source has the second highest LTV and an average CAC.\\\n",
    "Source 3 has the lowest ROMI (39%), because it is the most expensive one (has the highest CAC), but its LTV is average.\\\n",
    "Source 3 brings almost the same number of buyers and revenue as source 4 (the same LTV), but source 4 is twice cheaper in terms of CAC, which makes it more interesting for further development than source 3.\\\n",
    "Source 5 has paid off, but it is more expensive than source 4 and also brings less buyers than source 4, while the revenue from them is almost the same. This makes source 4 a better choice than source 5.\\\n",
    "Sources 2 and 9 have similar ROMI, but source 2 costs 2.5 times more than source 9. At the same time source 2 brings 3.5 times more buyers and their LTV is twice bigger than that of source 9.\\\n",
    "Source 10 has CAC similar to source 9 and brings even more buyers, but its LTV is smaller and ROMI is below 0, so it has not paid off.\\\n",
    "In general, ROMI is influenced by both LTV and CAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__*Recommendations:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since CAC is higher than the average check throughout all months, there is a need to revisit the marketing strategy, customer targeting, or pricing structure to ensure that customers are acquired more cost-effectively.\n",
    "2. June and September cohorts are the only ones that paid off, which makes their further exploration worthwhile, as was concluded in the Sales recommendations too.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. These ad sources should be developed further:\n",
    "   * source 1:\n",
    "       * has the highest ROMI\n",
    "       * is one of the most effective channels for customer conversion\n",

    "          at the same time source 2 brings 3.5 times more buyers and their LTV is twice bigger than that of source 9\n",
    "\n",
    "4. These ad sources should be cut out:\n",
    "    * source 3:\n",
    "        * has not paid off\n",
    "        * has the lowest ROMI\n",
    "        * is the most expensive channel, but its LTV is average\n",
    "        * brings almost the same number of buyers and revenue as source 4, but source 4 is twice cheaper in terms of CAC\n",
    "    * source 5:\n",
    "        * has paid off, but it is more expensive than source 4 and also brings less buyers than source 4,\n",
    "          while the revenue from them is almost the same. This makes source 4 a better choice than source 5.\n",
    "    * source 10:\n",
    "        * has not paid off\n",
    "        * has CAC similar to source 9 and brings even more buyers, but its LTV is smaller and ROMI is below 0\n",
    "\n",
    "5. These ad sources have a good potential:\n",
    "    * source 4:\n",
    "        * is cheap in terms of CAC\n",
    "        * while source 5 has paid off, it is more expensive than source 4 and also brings less buyers than source 4;\n",
    "          at the same time the revenue from them is almost the same.\n",
    "    * source 9:\n",
    "        * is one of the cheapest marketing channels\n",
    "        * has ROMI similar to source 2\n",
